# Canvas Learning Journal

The _Canvas Learning Journal_ (_CLJ_) tool helps instructors design and manage private student learning journals using standard Canvas functionality.

- [Demonstration](demonstration/index.md)
- [Reference](reference/index.md)

## Why?

Maintaining a learning journal encourages students to improve their engagement with the process of their learning.

Canvas does not provide a journal tool. 

Using groups and discussion forums manually is [known to be cumbersome](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Idea-Conversations/Implementing-private-journals-into-Canvas/idi-p/444842)

> Private journals are hard to create though on Canvas.

> I still fail to see why Canvas cannot implement a functionality for personal reflection within the platform. It would not be difficult and reflection is such an integral part of learning that its absence is a real weakness. We need to be able to make the learning process visible to the tutor to support and guide it appropiately.

> How can we get a proper journal function added to CANVAS for Fall 2021 (Instead of having faculty spending so much precious time creating the pseudo-journal alternatives?

# Canvas Learning Journal

!!! warning "Early stages of development"

    This project is in the early stages of development. It is not yet ready for use.

## What?

A tool to simplify the creation and orchestration of individual and private student learning journals using standard Canvas functionality (individual groups, and discussion forums).

## Why?

Journals are an increasingly important learning activity.

Canvas does not provide a journal tool. 

Using groups and discussion forums manually is [known to be cumbersome](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Idea-Conversations/Implementing-private-journals-into-Canvas/idi-p/444842)

## How?

!!! note "Still under development"

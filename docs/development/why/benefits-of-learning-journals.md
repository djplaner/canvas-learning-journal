# Benefits of Learning Journals

The scholarly literature includes many studies examining learning journals. 

## References from Park (2003)

The following table summarises the positives and negatives of learning journals as identified by Park (2003).

| Positive aspects | Negative aspects |
| --- |  --- |
| Ownership | Difficulty of the task |
| --- |  --- |
| Awareness of learning | Constraints (word limit) |
| Self-confidence | Uncertainty |
| Regular reading | Assessment - some preferences for traditional approaches |
| Focus on the whole course |  |
| Engagement with the material |  |
| Reflectivity |  |

Park (2003) draws on published literature to offer the following benefits.

-   Allowing students to make sense of their own personal histories (Hedlund et al., 1989)
-   Allowing students to assimilate and integrate new information (Hedlund et al., 1989)
-   Encouraging students to learn to think more about the knowledge they have or are acquiring (Hedlund et al., 1989)
-   Encouraging students to learn to use new knowledge (Hedlund et al., 1989)
-   Promoting long-term retention of course concepts (Croxton & Berger, 2001)
-   Increasing student test and exam grades (Connor-Greene, 2000; Hyers, 2001)
-   Stimulating critical thinking amongst students (Hettich, 1990)
-   Giving students opportunities to express themselves and develop effective means of self-expression (Hettich, 1990)
-   Helping to build trust between teacher and learner (Lohman & Schwalbe, 1996)
-   Providing formative evaluation for the teacher and thus help to identify the need to adjust teaching strategies (Lohman & Schwalbe, 1996); as Carroll (1994) puts it, "the data in the journals inform teachers about what is occurring in learners' heads"
-   Helping students to understand their own learning process and 'learn how to learn' (Lohman & Schwalbe, 1996)
-   Providing students with developmental feedback on their learning (Hettich, 1990)
-   Helping students' cognitive and affective development (Lohman & Schwalbe, 1996)
-   Helping students to improve their writing by focusing on processes rather than on products, emphasising expressive and personal aspects, and serving as a record of thought and expression that is available for rereading (Yinger, 1985)

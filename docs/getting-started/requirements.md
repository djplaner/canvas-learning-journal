The requirements for installing and using the _Canvas Learning Journal_ (_CLJ_) tool include:

1. A [teacher user role](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/What-user-roles-and-permissions-are-available-in-Canvas/ta-p/102) for a Canvas course site.

    _CLJ_ provides additional functionality to help teaching staff design and management learning journal tasks. Students engage with these learning journal tasks through standard Canvas tools. Hence _CLJ_ only works for teacher roles.

2. Use a web browser to access the Canvas course site.

    The _CLJ_ tool is a browser extension that works with the Canvas web interface. It does not work with the Canvas mobile app. 

## Getting started

With these requirements there's a two step process for getting started. The following summarises this process and provides links to more detailed instructions (with screen shots).

1. [Install](./install.md) the necessary software

    - Install the Tampermonkey browser extension.
    - Install the _Canvas Learning Journal_ user script.

2. [Use](./use.md) the _Canvas Learning Journal_ tool

    Use your teacher role to visit the [_People_ page](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-People-page-in-a-course-as-an-instructor/ta-p/667) in a Canvas course site. The _CLJ_ widget should appear just under the _Everyone_ tab.

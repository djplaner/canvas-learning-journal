Each learning journal task is implemented as a Canvas Group set Student learning journal A space where one (or possibly more) student engages in the learning journal task. Each learning journal is implemented as a Canvas group. A group which belongs to the group set associated with the learning journal task. Prompts A set of questions or other stimuli to which students are expected to respond as part of the learning journal task. Each prompt is implemented as a Canvas discussion topic. Each discussion can be graded or not. Entries An entry is a response to a prompt by students or instructors. Depending on the learning journal task design students may be expected to make multiple entries.
